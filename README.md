How does it work?

1. Equity generates a random possible ethereum private key hex
2. Equity tries to access using the generated possible private key
3. If private key is valid and Equity was able to access a wallet, it goes further. Otherwise it will return to Step 1. That's a [BAD MATCH]
4. Equity fetch acquired wallet ETH balance.
5. If fetched ETH balance is greater than 0,002 ETH(5$, writing time). It goes further. Otherwise it will return to to Step 1. That's a [BAD HIT]
6. Finally, if the overtaken wallet has enough ETH for transactions, Equity will automatically send the recovered ETH to your main ethereum address
7. Once transactions are submitted, Equity will display TxHASH and transferred balance.
8. Equity will continue trying to find another wallet. Repeating from Step 1

FAQ.

Is this a virus?
No, our .exe file is getting detected as a trojan because of the Python script, we are working on it. You can take a look at the Source Code and if you still doesn't feel safe opening it you can compile source code by yourself

How much time to get a hit?
Brute force cracking method doesn't have an estimated time for completion. It may takes a long time as it may take a very short time.

Is it legal to use this program?
Yes, once you brute force a wallet private key, you are automatically recognized as the wallet owner. Therefore you are able to perform everything on that wallet.
